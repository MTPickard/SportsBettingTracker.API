# SportsBettingTracker.API

Because of having members with different OS issues, out project uses a secrets.config file.
Secrets.config may or may not exist/function for you.  
If it does not work or you do not have one, here is the string for a normal machine;

<?xml version="1.0"?>

<connectionStrings>
    <add name="DefaultConnection" connectionString="Data Source=(LocalDb)\MSSQLLocalDB;Initial Catalog=SportsBettingTracker;Integrated Security=True;" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
</connectionStrings>

There is a seperate client built as a start on a UI.
